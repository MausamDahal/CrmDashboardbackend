## ðŸ§¾ NestCRM â€“ Backend (Dashboard)

This repository contains the **backend server** for the NestCRM Dashboard â€“ a multi-tenant, secure, and scalable API service that powers CRM operations such as customer tracking, subscription management, churn prediction, and AI-driven alerts. 

Each business (tenant) operates in **full isolation** via dynamic subdomains, token-based authentication, and dedicated DynamoDB tables. The backend is responsible for:

- Customer management
- AI prediction integrations
- Risk alert generation
- Subscription validation
- Secure API access via JWT and API keys
- Multi-tenant infrastructure enforcement

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Predictions** â€“ Integrates machine learning models to flag churn risk.
- **Multi-Tenant Security** â€“ Isolated tables and domains per tenant.
- **Subscription Enforcement** â€“ Stripe-integrated subscription control.
- **RESTful APIs** â€“ Modular routes for customers, orders, support, payments, and more.
- **Cloud Native** â€“ Designed for AWS: EC2, S3, CloudFront, Route53, DynamoDB.
